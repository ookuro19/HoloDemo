# HoloDemo
##Introdution
There are some Examples about HoloToolkit. I also make some attempts to find out what the toolkit does.

##List some examples what I think useful 
###GazeEvents
This example shows how can we use gaze to trigger some events.

###GazeRuler
GazeRuler tells us that we can use raycast to place point on a detected plane.

###SpatialProcessing
SpatialProcessing tells us that we can place a cube on a detected plane. And we can change material of detected planes.

###ClickTST
I use this scene to find out the function how which we tap in air to trigger events.

###NormalAlignmentTST
I use this scene to find out how to align the direction of the target object with the normal of the detection plane.

###SpatialMappingTST
I use this scene to adjust the material of detected plane.
